# Snakes-and-Ladders-UoB-2nd-year

This repo contains my 2nd year final project for the Java module, which was to create a Snakes and Ladder game that could be played by multiple parties over a given network. This includes programs for the board itself, the server controlling the game, and the clients connecting to and playing the game.
